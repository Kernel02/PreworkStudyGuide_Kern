# Prework Study Guide

## Definition
- The prework-study-guide a tool that students of the University or Richmond coding bootcamp can utilize to look back on and study the material taught in the prework. It contains a header with the title of the project, an image of a cat in a bowtie, and a note to "Open the Console to See What's Happening". Under the heading is each topic, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, along with the notes about them.  I built this project to help my fellow classmates and I exceed in learning and executing the fundamentals of coding. During this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Combining all of the information that I learned, I was able to develop this study that utilizes HTML to give the structure of the page, CSS to bring stylization to the page, and JavaScript that adds interactivity to the page within the DevTools console.

## Usage
- Inside the DevTools console, one could find the list of topics from the prework as well as a randomly selected topic for them to begin studying.

### Future Additions
- In the future, I would llike to add more structure to the study guide by organizing the notes in each topic into smaller categories and adding more unordered lists under the categories with the proper content.
