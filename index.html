        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE declares what type of document the browser should expect to open. (not required, but standard in HTML documents)</li>
          <li>An HTML element and tag are one in the same.</li>
          <li>Most elements have opening and closing tags, if they do, they are also capable of having "child" elements within it.</li>
          <li>The html tag represents the start of our document. Inside this will be our attributes.
          </li>
          <li>An attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization(SEO).</li>
          <li>The section element will be used to organize the content of our code to put similar working things together. This is similar to a "section" in a newspaper.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descritption, keywords, auther, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML documenet.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is known as the parent element, thus all of the elements inside of it are called the child elements.</li>
          <li>The content of visible HTML elements is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. Opening tag: head  Closing tag: /head</li>
          <li>The h1 through h6 are heading elements. The heading will be in a larger or more prominent print.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul element is for unordered lists and the ol element is for ordered lists. The li element is a list item and will be put within either the ul or ol elements.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are diplayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between the two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a (whcih stands for anchor) element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribuute points to the URLfor the link.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location(URL) of the external recourse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declerations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declerations contain two important componentsl: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. An example would be as follows: color: blue;  "color" is the property and "blue" is the value of said property.</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. A margin with a property of 0 would have no extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all of the visible elements on a page, the * selctor will be used.</li>
          <li>To apply rules to multiple elements, but not all, just simply list all of the elements you wish to apply the rules to, using a comma in between them. For example: header, (next line) footer.</li>
          <li>Remember DRY code, or in other words Do Not Repeat Yourself code. Share pieces of code when able to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written and maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align is a positioning property we can use to center a title or heading on a webpage by giving it the value of center.</li>
          <li>Using the img selector will assign property to all of the image elements in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property with the value of block will make all of images start on a new line.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>  
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to said branch</li>
        <li>git add -A commits all of the files in the working branch</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>  
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript adds interactivity to projects.</li>
        <li>Use let to declare variables that will change later.</li>
        <li>Use const to declare variables that will not change.</li>
        <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. However, it is only required when you need to seperate statements on a single line.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
        <li>A string is a sequence of text. To signify that the value is a string, enlcose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
        <li>When a value is set as a number, quotation marks will not be used.</li>
        <li>Boolean is a true/flase value, which do not need quotation marks.</li>
        <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
        <li>An object can be anything. All objects can be stored in a variable.</li>
        <li>Comments can be added with /* "comment */. When making a comment with no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes instead: //"comment".</li>
        <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values(or variables)</li>
        <li>The operation, addition, adds two numbers together or combines two strings. Symbol: +</li>
        <li>The operations, subtraction, multiplication, adn diviion, do exactly what you'd expect them to do. Symbols: -,*,/</li>
        <li>The operation, assignment, assigns a value to a variable. Symbol: =</li>
        <li>The operation, strict equality, performs a test to see if two values are equal. A true/fale(Boolean) result will return. Symbol: ===</li>
        <li>The operation, not, does-not-equal, returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true value into a false value etc.. When it is used alongside the equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal. Symbol: !, !==</li>
        <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
        <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
        <li>Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example in handling is the "click event".</li>
        <li>All value types except eobjects define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. These values are refered to as primitive values.</li>
        <li>Null type typeof return value: object  Object Wrapper: N/A</li>
        <li>Undefined type typeof return value: undefined  Object Wrapper: N/A</li>
        <li>All other types typeof return values and object wrapper: Same as the type itslef</li>
        <li>NaN(Not a Number) is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
        <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
        <li>The string type respresents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units.</li>
        <li>JavaScript strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.</li>
        <li>A symbol type is a unique immutable primitive value and may be used as  the key of an Object property.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code, this isn't only for js.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, thus our order of code matters.</li>
        <li>The if statement is a conditional statement that will only execute the code if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
        <li>The following values are considered falsy values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, Nan, and the false boolean value. All other values are considered truthy values.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning that the first item in any array has an index of 0, the second, 1, the third, 2, and so on.</li>
        <li>A for loop used the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. An if statement is an example that would interrupt our for loop.</li>
        <li>x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
