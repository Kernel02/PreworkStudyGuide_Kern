          <li>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declerations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declerations contain two important componentsl: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. An example would be as follows: color: blue;  "color" is the property and "blue" is the value of said property.</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. A margin with a property of 0 would have no extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all of the visible elements on a page, the * selctor will be used.</li>
          <li>To apply rules to multiple elements, but not all, just simply list all of the elements you wish to apply the rules to, using a comma in between them. For example: header, (next line) footer.</li>
          <li>Remember DRY code, or in other words Do Not Repeat Yourself code. Share pieces of code when able to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written and maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align is a positioning property we can use to center a title or heading on a webpage by giving it the value of center.</li>
          <li>Using the img selector will assign property to all of the image elements in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property with the value of block will make all of images start on a new line.</li>
